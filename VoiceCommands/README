- Project is made by using Swift, Xcode 13.4.1, MacOS 12.4

- Project is tested and works as expected on iPhone Simulators and iPhone 11 (iOS 15.3.1). 

- To add new command go to -> Configs/VoiceCommandsConfig.swift, and and new class for command with its command-String.

- To support new language add new language in Configs/LanguageConfifg.swift. App Does not support multiple language at the moment.




Some production ready features are missing as mentioned below:

- Sometimes iOS ends the audio session randomly, which needs to be handled. Presently we are checking with timer and activate the session after 60 seconds.

- App Does not support multiple language at the moment.

- Project does not contain test cases.
